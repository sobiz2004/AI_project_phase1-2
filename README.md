# AI_project_phase1-2
# Project Phase 1 – Image Segmentation

This project focuses on **image segmentation** using the UNet architecture and its variations. The models were implemented from scratch in PyTorch and evaluated on segmentation tasks.

## Implemented Models
- **UNet**
- **Attention UNet**
- **Residual Attention UNet**

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Dice Score

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies.
2. Run the notebook `Project_Phase1.ipynb` or use the provided Python script.
3. Check the evaluation metrics and visual results inside the notebook.

The project also includes a presentation video explaining the methodology and results.

# Project Phase 2 – Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

This project implements the **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** reinforcement learning algorithm. SAC is an off-policy algorithm that maximizes both the expected reward and policy entropy, encouraging better exploration during training.

## Key Features
- Implementation of SAC from scratch
- Training in physics-based environments (PyBullet)
- Utility functions for visualization of training progress
- Performance demonstration videos included

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies, including PyBullet.
2. Run the notebook `SAC_notebook.ipynb` or the provided Python script.
3. Visualize the training process and review the agent’s performance in the videos.

The project includes presentation and demonstration videos for better understanding.
